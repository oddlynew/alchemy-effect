// The operation
/**
 * Send a Solana transaction
 *
 * Signs and sends a single Solana transaction using multiple Solana accounts. The transaction may contain contain several instructions, each of which may require signatures from different account keys.
 * The transaction should be serialized into a byte array and base64 encoded. The API handles recent blockhash management and fee estimation, leaving the developer to provide only the minimal set of fields necessary to send the transaction.
 * **Transaction types**
 * The following transaction types are supported:
 * * [Legacy transactions](https://solana.com/developers/guides/advanced/versions#current-transaction-versions)
 * * [Versioned transactions](https://solana.com/developers/guides/advanced/versions)
 * **Instruction Batching**
 * To batch multiple operations, include multiple instructions within a single transaction. All instructions within a transaction are executed atomically - if any instruction fails, the entire transaction fails and is rolled back.
 * **Network Support**
 * The following Solana networks are supported:
 * * `solana` - Solana Mainnet
 * * `solana-devnet` - Solana Devnet
 * The developer is responsible for ensuring that the unsigned transaction is valid, as the API will not validate the transaction.
